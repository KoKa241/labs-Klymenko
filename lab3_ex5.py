# this program computes the number of seconds in a given number of hours

hours = 2
seconds = 3600 # number of seconds in 1 hour

print("Hours: ", hours)
print("Seconds in Hours: ", hours * seconds) # printing the number of seconds in a given number of hours

#here we should also print "Goodbye", but a programmer didn't have time to write any code
